REQUIREMENTS:

YAPPA requires PHP 4.0 or later with GD library extension or ImageMagick's "convert" 
utility.
You can find ImageMagick at http://www.imagemagick.org/ and GD library at 
http://www.boutell.com 

INSTALLATION:

* Untar yappa.tar under your document root
  
  $ cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs
  $ tar zxvf yappa-1.x.tar.gz
  
  and rename it into as you want:
  
  $ mv yappa-1.x yappa
  
  (you could also make a symlink instead of renaming the directory)

* Create a photos directory anywhere under your document root, this directory will 
  contain all of your albums.

  $ mkdir /usr/local/apache/htdocs/photos

* Upload your pictures in the photos directory. 
  You will group them in "albums", that is to say in separate subdirectories under the
  photos directory. (e.g. creating a directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/photos/travels/ 
  creates the album 'travels'). 
  You can make as many of these directories as you like. 
  You must only check the permissions and make sure that the web server is able to write 
  in these directories.
  
  $ chmod a+w /usr/local/apache/htdocs/photos/travels

* Edit config.inc.php to suit your needs. You will need to make sure that the "photo_root"
  variable is set to the full path to the photos directory.
  photo_root => "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/photos"

* Just point your browser at the directory you've created in the first step and enjoy
  (e.g. http://www.mysite.com/yappa/)

* Optionally you can activate the "hits logger" by creating an empty file named hits.log
  under the yappa directory, make sure that the web server can write to this file.
  Under unix you do:
  $ touch /usr/local/apache/htdocs/yappa/hits.log
  $ chmod a+w /usr/local/apache/htdocs/yappa/hits.log

* You could also comment your albums and you images by creating two files in the album
  directory (info.txt for album name/comment and captions.txt for commenting the images).
  You can find two sample files in the 'album-sample' directory.
